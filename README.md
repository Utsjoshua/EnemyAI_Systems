# EnemyAI_Systems
Made using Unreal Engine 5.2 and C++

This project was made for a group assignment in Advanced Games Programming for my University. It contains Enemy AIs which are meant to chase and attack the player. 

There are 2 Enemy AI in this Unreal project.
The first AI (RED) is moving around the map to try to chase the player when it sees the player in its view.
The second AI (YELLOW) is standing still on the high ground which can target the player by shooting beams at them to attack
Together you have 2 AI which search for and attacks the player when they are caught.

The project also allows for Multiplayer as up to 4 players can be controlled at one time.
The players are coloured as BLUE.
